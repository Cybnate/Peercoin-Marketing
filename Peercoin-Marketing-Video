This file is created to allow commits against it and provide some transparancy to who and why funds are paid.

Commits will only be pulled when objectives of the charter in the read.me are met.
For each commit which drains funds an entry will be made in this file in the following format
Commits without payments (#free) are not added. This can be spam or just maintaining the project files by 
project maintainer. Other relevant transactions (e.g. exchange to fiat if required) will also be added in here 
as a kind of ledger.

Name receiver: amount received: reason
eg:
