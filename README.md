Peercoin-Marketing
==================

Project primarily created to raise funds to create a video promoting Peercoin through peer4commit


Charter for Fundraising for Peercoin video - 900 PPC

Fundraising to promote Peercoin brand and educate users about the use of Peercoins through freely r- distributable videos, audio and written media. The fund is primarily used to pay professionals and any materials or services they need to achieve the stated objective.

The objective is to have a video meeting at least the following requirements:

1. Needs to be made by a professional 

2. Need to promote Peercoin brand, the advantages, its use and/or functionality

3. Needs to be re-broadcastable on TV so to keep costs down, use whatever is creative commons for audio.

4. Some people with English as their 2nd language will be watching this, so let's not talk too quickly or fill the background with too much music or sound.

5. Limit music to a minimum. Nothing worse than loud (or unnecessary) music in the background making it difficult to hear what the speaker or narrator is saying.

6. Duration: at least 30 seconds


Stretch target(s) for any fundraising above 900 PPC (~US$1800) or funds remaining after the initial requirements above are met:
1. Having a longer video up to 180 seconds (3 minutes), which can be split up in pieces between 30-90 seconds and can be broadcasted as specific or focussed messages

OR

2. Having another video produced of up to 90 seconds after the initial requirements have been met


Any remaining funds will go to the distribution of this video or videos e.g. people in and outside the community hosting, sharing or promoting the material in some way. Each effort can be rewarded between 0.1% and 5% of the remaining funds. Candidates who think they are eligible for this reward have to obtain the positive vote of at least 5 active volunpeers and showcasing their effort. If there are more requests than funds in a short term a voting thread will be run for at least 7 days to select the people who will recieve a reward and how much.

Release of funds

1. The release of funds will be trough peercommit.com either direct to the receiver using the peer4commit mechanism.
Given the current restraints on peer4commit of releasing the total fund or large chunks of it, the project maintainer may have to manually drain the fund before transferring it as one payment to the receiver. That action might also include exchanging Peercoins into fiat if that's the only method of payment accepted.

2. This fundraiser doesn't intend to be a long-term marketing fund. For other targets it is suggested to start a new fundraiser with another charter. Therefore the project maintainer will release the funds if the targets or stretch targets are not met withing 3 months time. Where these funds will be released to will be subject to a voting process on peercointalk.org.





Any questions can be posted on peercointalk.org or raised as an issue on the repo on Github.

The project maintainer will try to respond questions within 48 hours or indicate that an anwers is underway but might take a bit more time. Any spam will be ignored and deleted.
